1. data/cf.yaml has info on training images directory. Run training with python train.py --img 320 --batch 8 --epochs 10 --data data/cf.yaml --weights /home/akmaral/server/yolov3/runs/train/yolov3-tiny/weights/best.pt. 
Here I am setting initial weights. 

1.1 For the test, run python detect.py --weights runs/train/yolov3-tiny/weights/best.pt --source /home/akmaral/Desktop/yolo_test/**/*.jpg --save-txt - to run a detection on a set of images. Dataset should be images/train, images/val and labels/train, labels/val in the same folder.

2. yolov3-tiny-real-1: trained on ~500 real images with one CF in images. Transfer learning with yolov3-tiny-synth-1. 10 epochs

3. yolov3-tiny-synth-1: trained on 4.5k synthetic images with one CF in images. 

4. get-bb-position.py reads labels.txt files from run/detect/exp/labels folder. csv for camera and robot should be provided propeprly. Camera state and robot state should be uploaded properly.
